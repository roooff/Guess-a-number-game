I guess ill call this version 0.1 - I dont know how to generate a random number so i though to make a calculation and get something close to it .My logic was : 100-input =randomNumber .But if u think for a bit u will see that the only number u can guess is 50.
For next time (version 0.2) im thinking to include the 	ASCII table. My thoughts are: int a ; 100-input = Char.a*2; I think this might get a random number after all.
Peace!! Good night.
